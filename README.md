🚀 About Me

Java Full Stack & Distributed Systems Engineer with 4+ years of experience building high-performance microservices, event-driven architectures, and cloud-native applications across finance, healthcare, and telecom.

I specialize in architecting backend systems that process $500M+ daily transactions, handle 2M+ real-time messages, and consistently deliver 99.9% uptime with sub-200ms API response times using Java, Spring Boot, React, Kafka, AWS, and Kubernetes.

🎯 Currently seeking a backend or full-stack engineering role where I can contribute to large-scale distributed systems, real-time data platforms, and high-throughput API architectures.
